Title:​ Match the Tiles

Description:​ Match the Tiles is a game that tests your memory. Cards will be flipped over on the screen and when clicked, they will flip over. 
If you match two, they stay flipped over. If all cards are flipped you will win the round. Each round, the game will have more cards. A list of 
High Scores (a.k.a Fastest Times) will be in the Cloud, so you can see high scores from other people for each round.
